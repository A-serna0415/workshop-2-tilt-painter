# :art: Tilt Painter
*This is a real-time, collaborative painting system that uses a phone’s gyroscope, built with **p5.js**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **WebSockets**.*

*Users steer the brush by tilting their phone, and multiple people can join at the same time to leave marks on the same shared canvas.*

*The idea is simple, to turn small personal gestures into a collective drawing, where motion becomes a shared, temporary language.*

### Requirements
*Android/iOS mobile.*

### How to run
- Pressed the "Enable Button" on screen and allow the web app to use the device movement.
- The brush will appear on the centre of the canvas.
- Tilt the phone smoothly so you can control the trace.
- Tap the screen to re-calibrate the device movement data.
