# :art: Tilt Painter
*This is a real-time, collaborative painting system that uses a phone’s gyroscope, built with **p5.js**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **WebSockets**.*

*Users steer the brush by tilting their phone, and multiple people can join at the same time to leave marks on the same shared canvas.*

*The idea is simple, to turn small personal gestures into a collective drawing, where motion becomes a shared, temporary language.*
